			 <span lang = "ru"> reserves of time of noncritical works in this respect are of value. Shifting noncritical work in this or that direction, but within the limits of its reserve of time, it is possible to achieve decrease in the maximal need for resources. At absence of restrictions on resources reserves of time are usually used for alignment of needs for resources during all term of realization of the program. It is necessary to mean, that reserves of time of noncritical works depend from each other, and the delay of the beginning of performance of one of them can lead to reduction of reserves of time of other noncritical works.
