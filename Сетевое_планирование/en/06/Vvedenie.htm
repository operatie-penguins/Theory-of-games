            Among the methods developed for last years with the purpose of designing of manufacture or researches and supervision over their performance, «network methods of planning», based idea of a critical way, take leading place owing to simplicity, efficiency and riches of opportunities which do not cease to be found out in them. Undoubtedly, that engineers, organizers of manufacture, businessmen, planners and in general all persons and the groups of persons bearing the responsibility for development and the control of projects, can estimate the opportunities opening owing to network methods of planning; the present work is attempt to show it value of these methods. These methods are not universal, and many problems cannot be solved with their help. In process of îãî as new methods of the organization and planning open and take root, it is found out also, that again arising problems demand or more perfect, or absolutely other algorithms.
