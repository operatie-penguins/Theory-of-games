The network schedule of the project name evident representation of the project in the form of a network. Arches of this network represent operations (work) and are focused; the direction of arches corresponds to process of realization of the program in time. The attitude of ordering between operations is set by means of events. Event is defined as the moment of time when one operations come to the end both others begin, and it is represented in a network in unit (top).
